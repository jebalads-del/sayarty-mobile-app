 * Provides a reference point for correcting bounds measurements.

 * When a parent view has transforms applied (e.g., during screen transitions),

 * establishes an anchor point (typically the screen container at 0,0) and exposes
 * a `correctMeasurement` function that reverses translation and scale transforms
 * to yield the true layout position and dimensions.
 *
 * ## How it works
 *
 * 1. **Translation**: Subtract anchor's pageX/pageY offset
 * 2. **Scale**: Compare anchor's measured size to expected (screen) size to compute
 *    scale factor, then divide positions and dimensions by that factor
